Amazon Alexa Skill that Gets All [FRESH] Songs From r/HipHopHeads

This skill allows you to ask Amazon Alexa to check whats [FRESH] on r/HipHopHeads. You can also ask for the link to be sent to your Amazon Alexa companion app. Right now Amazon dosen't allow hyperlinks to be sent to the companion app (not sure why) so for now its in plain text.

You can specify your favourite artists and Alexa will check if there's any new songs by them.
